Hi, I'm Aditya Athalye and I *[eval/apply](https://evalapply.org)* for joy â™¥
==========================

To me, `eval/apply` is not just a deep concept in computing [^1]. It is
also deeply symbolic of the nondual yin/yang nature of thinking-doing,
of abstraction-concretion, of idealism-pragmatism.

- ***Eval***: Think culture over strategy, humans over technology,
  systems over hacks, workflows over tools.
- ***Apply***: Design by *subtraction* [^2], engineer for simplicity,
  produce output iteratively, ship continuously.

My interests include [\#systems](https://evalapply.org/tags/systems/)
thinking, understanding and taming
[\#complexity](https://evalapply.org/tags/complexity/), software
[\#architecture](https://evalapply.org/tags/architecture/),
[\#functional](https://evalapply.org/tags/functional_programming/) programming, and my
favourite programming language,
[\#clojure](https://evalapply.org/tags/clojure/).

Keenly aware that I stand on the shoulders of giants, I\'m here to pay
it forward...

Among other things, [I\'ve been writing here](https://evalapply.org/posts/) in the
spirit of thinking in public. Each year, I try to demo or teach at least
one thing I\'ve explored, at community-run tech conferences. I love to
\"learn generously\" [^3] with friends, colleagues, and fellow
gentlenerds (like you?).

And---unless I missed a memo---none of it has to feel like reading dry
prose on dusty wrinkled parchment, right? ... *Right?*

    unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is.\"*

[^3]: *Learn generously* is a \"self-directive\" coined by the
    gentlepeople at my favourite programmers\' community, the [Recurse
    Center](https://recurse.com).
