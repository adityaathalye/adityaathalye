Hi! I'm Aditya Athalye, a Human General Intelligence (pinky promise)
animated by the concept of *eval/apply*. As far as I can tell it
isn't my source code. I blog about software, complexity, organisations,
functional programming, Emacs, Clojure and more at [evalapply.org](https://www.evalapply.org).
