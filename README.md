Hi! I'm Aditya Athalye, a Human General Intelligence (pinky promise)
animated by the concept of *eval/apply*. As far as I can tell it isn't my source code.
I like to [blog](https://www.evalapply.org/posts/)
about software, complexity, systems, organisations, and more. 
I build B2B SaaS products and engineering systems. I strive to *build better
without burning out*. Here's why and how to [hire me](https://www.evalapply.org/hire.html).

All this and more at my site, [evalapply.org](https://www.evalapply.org).
